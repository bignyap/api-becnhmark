# Benchmark Comparison Report: Go vs Node.js vs Python

## Overview
This report compares the performance of three simple applicationsâ€”one built with Go, another with Node.js, and the third with Python. The applications were benchmarked using Apache Benchmark for three different scenarios: a "Hello World" endpoint, a random number generator, and a database connection simulation.

## Overall Summary

### **Throughput**:
- **Go** consistently outperforms both Node and Python across all benchmarks, delivering the highest requests per second.

### **Response Time**:
- **Go** offers the fastest response time, significantly outperforming Node and Python.

### **Transfer Rate**:
- **Node** excels in transfer rate, particularly when handling larger document sizes, though Go is still competitive in this area.

### **Failure Rate**:
- **Go** had the highest failure rate in the random number generator test (~54%), followed by Node (~39%) and Python (~10%). Despite the higher failure rate, Go maintained superior throughput and response times.

### **Python Performance**:
- **Python** lags behind in all metrics, with the lowest throughput, highest response times, and lowest transfer rates.

---

## Conclusion
- **Go** offers the best overall performance across all scenarios, providing high throughput, low response times, and solid transfer rates.
- **Node** performs well but generally trails Go in throughput and response times while excelling in transfer rate.
- **Python** is the slowest across all benchmarks, making it less ideal for performance-sensitive applications.

This benchmarking clearly highlights **Go** as the top performer for high-throughput applications. **Node** is a good alternative if data transfer speed is a higher priority, while **Python** is best suited for less performance-critical tasks.
